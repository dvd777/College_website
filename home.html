            The establishment of St. Josephs College of Engineering ,was the fulfillment of a long cherished dream of
            providing facilities for higher education to the people of the diocese and surrounding regions. The main
            objective is to develop a college with a distinct identity and character, where education and training are
            imparted in a truly Christian environment conducive to fostering Christian values such as faith in God, love
            for their fellow men and devotion to the motherland. Every facility is provided in the campus to create an
            environment fully conducive to realizing this objective.

            Discipline, hard work, positive thinking, commitment to excellence and abiding faith in the Almighty are the
            guiding principles that propel the college to its vision of emerging as a Centre of Excellence in technical
            education in the country. Value systems such as eco-friendliness, quality consciousness and work ethics are
            also being instilled through the special work culture and campus life existing in the college.
